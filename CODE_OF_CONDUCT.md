# Code of Conduct

The [Recap Time Squad Community Code of Conduct](https://policies.recaptime.dev/code-of-conduct)
applies to this open-source project by a squad member for
the code and non-code contributions via this repository. But since this is built as part of the
Hack Club Slack community, the [Hack Club Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct/) also apply here,
regardless of their elgibility for YSWS grants at Hack Club.

## Reporting CoC violations

**If a Hack Clubber is involved (either affliated with HQ/HCB or otherwise)**, please email <conduct@hackclub.com>
while CCing <abuse@recaptime.dev> (alternate address: <recaptimesquad+abuse@gmail.com>) and/or reach out directly to a member of the Fire Department.
In case the situtation crossed multiple communities alongside Hack Club and RecapTime.dev, please also report to other affecting communties too.

**For anyone else**, please email <abuse@recaptime.dev> with description and evidence of code of conduct violation. A squad member will look into the matter and take actions based on the evidence.

## Enforcement actions

Enforcement activites from project maintainers and Hack Club Firefighters should follow [this guideline](https://policies.recaptime.dev/code-of-conduct/#enforcement-guidelines)
adopted from [Mozilla's enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/inclusion/blob/master/code-of-conduct-enforcement/consequence-ladder.md)
unless in edge cases where requires drastic actions.

Each action must be logged at [public our moderation logs](https://transparency.recaptime.dev/modlog) by TBD.
