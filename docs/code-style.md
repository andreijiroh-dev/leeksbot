# Code style

We'll be setting up eslint and prettier later, but here's a gist
of the coding style here:

* Use spaces not tab, at least 2 spaces per indentation.
* No `;` at the end (for now)
* For local imports, we're not yet requiring file extensions yet but we'll flip
the flag on our TS configs.

We'll update this documentation for more details once linting and formatting tools
are enabled here. Patches are much welcome to improve our coding style :)
